This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling.  The `strpos()` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, but `false` is also equivalent to `0` in a loose comparison. Therefore, if the substring is found at index 0, the condition `strpos($haystack, $needle) != false` will evaluate to true, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. 

```php
<?php
$haystack = "hello world";
$needle = "hello";
if (strpos($haystack, $needle) != false) {
  echo "Substring found!";
}
?>
```
